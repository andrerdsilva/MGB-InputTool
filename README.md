## Usage
Once installed, the plugin can be used to prepare and manage input data for the MGB-IPH hydrological model, simplifying workflows for hydrological and climatological data processing.

### How to Use

1. **Data Requirements**
   - Precipitation, discharge, and climate data files must have a date column in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`.
   - **Precipitation data files** should include the following columns:
     - `date`
     - `precipitation`
   - **Discharge data files** should include the following columns:
     - `date`
     - `flow`
   - Climate data files should include the following columns:
     - `date`
     - `Temp (Â°C)`
     - `RelHum (%)`
     - `Wind10m (m/s)`
     - `SunHours (h)`
     - `AtmPres (mb)`
   - The column separator for the files should be a comma `,`.

2. **Using the Plugin**
   - Navigate to one of the three tabs in the plugin interface: **Precipitation**, **Discharge**, or **Climate Variables**.
   - Select the input folder containing `.csv` files for the chosen data type.
   - Example files can be found in the **"Example"** folder.

*Note: The `date` field allows adjusting the initial date of the data, which is useful when the hydrological model has a date limit for inserting future data.*
